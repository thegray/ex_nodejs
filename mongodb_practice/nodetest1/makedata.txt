1. Create data directory
-> Go to bin, run "mkdir data"

2. Run database server
-> Call mongod.exe from mongo installed directory with additional param path to data directory
-> run ' "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath c:\node\nodetest1\data\ '
-> Wait until it says "[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017"

3. Open Mongo Console (to act as a mongo client, CRUD our db)
-> open another command prompt, call mongo.exe
-> eq: run ' "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongo.exe" '

4. Create a db
-> in mongo console, run "use {db_name}"
-> eq: run "use nodetest1"

5. Add record to collection
-> in mongo console, run insert command
-> eq: run 'db.usercollection.insert({ "username" : "testuser1", "email" : "testuser1@testdomain.com" })'
-> or, newstuff = [{"username" : "testuser2", "email" : "testuser2@testdomain.com" }, { "username" : "testuser3", "email" : "testuser3@testdomain.com"}]
-> db.usercollection.insert(newstuff)
-> db here stands for database created before, which is "nodetest1"
-> usercollection is part of the collection, it is autocreated

6. View record
-> in mongo console, run "db.usercollection.find().pretty()"
-> pretty command will give result with linebreaks
